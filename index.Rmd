# Intro to intro

## Sharing is caring {.flexbox .vcenter}

![alt text](sharingcaring.gif)

*Sharing your meal is optional

## Main principles of workshops:

Each workshop should be hands-on practise:

- Share information
- Implement
- Figure it out why it is useful and start using it on daily routine

You will never learn anything completely just by looking at presentation.

## 

Possible scenario of any workshop:

>- Trying to understand information
>- Practising
>- Practising
>- Frustration pause
>- Practising
>- Practising
>- Frustration pause
>- Practising
>- Oh, does it work?
>- It works!
>- Champagne -- ba-dum-tss

# Git & GitHub

## What are those Git & GitHub?

Git is version control system designed by Linus Tornvald, the creator of Linux kernel.

GitHub is web-based service for Git.

GitHub is mostly used for simple development of projects using version control. This allows user freely develop alone or collaborate with others. 

Moreover, GitHub is more or less a community, where people share and learn. Many of open source tools firstly appears on GitHub. Then other users could easily report bugs on your project, develop additional features, expand your project scope, *etc*.

##

Q: But I am not a developer, I AM DATA SCIENTIST, why should I use such a tool?

A: Because:

>- You (probably) write code too 
>- You (probably) work on the project with your colleagues
>- You (probably) don't back-up your projects
>- You (probably) would like to access your projects anytime, anywhere
>- You can see this presentation via GitHub

Any more questions?

## Plan of mini workshop

1. Configure GitHub accounts with your computers
2. Create a repository on GitHub.com
3. Clone repo, create a file and write something sad 
4. Add, commit and push that sad file to GitHub
5. Clone your colleagues repository to your computer

## Configuring and Opening GitHub

Firstly setting yourself as a user:

```
$ git config --global user.name "exacaster"
$ git config --global user.email "exacaster@exacaster.com"
```

To confirm your settings:

```
$ git config --global user.email exacaster@exacaster.com
```

## Creating a repo on github.com

Everything in GitHub exist as repositories aka repos. One could imagine repo as a folder of project where all code or any files are stored. 

To create a repo on github.com:

- Open github.com
- Select 'New repository'
- Write down your repo name
- Click 'Create repository'

## Cloning repo to your computer

Every repo could be cloned to your local machine using SSH clone URL.

Imagine cloning just as simple copy & paste procedure with hidden Git structure skeleton.

Run on GitHub shell:

```
$ git clone ssh_clone_url
```

And go to cloned directory:

```
$ cd repo_name
```

Notice that additional information about repo appears on GitHub shell.

## README.md

Every repo has a read me file where short summary of project is stated. 

These files are written in Markdown (.md extension) formatting syntax which could be easily converted to HTML.

This presentation is written in Markdown too.

To create a file and open it with text editor, eg Notepad:

```
$ touch README.md

$ notepad README.md
```

Now write few words about your saddest project yet and save the file.

## foo.txt

Now we have a project but no project files yet. 

Let's create text file and fill it with sad story.

```
$ touch foo.txt
$ notepad foo.txt
```

Write sad story and save the file. 

To check situation of your project:

```
$ git status
```

## Adding, commiting and pushing

Once read me and file is created, we want them to appear on github.com. 

This is done with three easy steps:

- Adding files to your local repository and staging for commiting:

  ```
  $ git add README.md
  ```
  
- Commiting your updates (still locally):

  ```
  $ git commit -m "initial commit"
  ```
  
- Pushing your changes to GitHub:

  ```
  $ git push
  ```

And if nothing have failed... open your repo on github.com/username/reponame.

## WE ARE VICTORIOUS {.flexbox .vcenter}

![alt text](happy.gif)

Congrats, it is your first project on GitHub!

## Creating new repo using shell

Before excersise we still need to learn something more.

We will create a repo using github-shell.

Firstly, we need to create a directory where repo will exists:

```
$ mkdir reponame
$ cd reponame
```

To initialize Git skeleton to your repo:

```
$ git init
```

## Practice makes you perfect

Now we are going to repeat almost the same steps but in a little different manner. 

In yours just created repo do the following excersise steps:

- Create README.md and text file there
- Add, commit, push these files
- Check if repo was successfully created
- Give your created repo ssh_clone_url to colleague on the left
- Clone your colleague's on the right repo

## What else GitHub has to offer?

There are many other GitHub very useful features:

- Branching -- availability to create branches of particular project and users work on different parts and then just merge the project into one
- Forking -- fork someone else's project and develop furthermore as yourself
- Issue tracking -- essential when developing a bigger project
- GitHub Pages -- availability to publish your website on GitHub

## What should **I** use GitHub?

- You want to back up your projects in case of fire/armageddon/disk failure
- When working on same project, you would like to co-operate with others, *eg* Kaggle competitions
- You are using open source tools and always want to be updated, *eg* some R libraries firstly appear on GitHub before CRAN, moreover development updates are always firstly on GitHub
- You would like to make such a presentations and show them easily on browser using GitHub pages
- And many more features which I don't know/use yet...
