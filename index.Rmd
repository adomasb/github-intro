# Intro to intro

## Sharing is caring {.flexbox .vcenter}

![alt text](sharing.jpg)

*Reading more about STDs is optional

## Main principles of workshops:

Each workshop should be hands-on practise:

- Share information
- Implement
- Figure it out why it is useful and start using it on daily routine

You will never learn anything completely just by looking at presentation.

## 

Possible scenario of any workshop:

>- Trying to understand information
>- Practising
>- Practising
>- Frustration pause
>- Practising
>- Practising
>- Frustration pause
>- Practising
>- Oh, does it work?
>- It works!
>- Champagne -- ba-dum-tss

# Git & GitHub

## What are those Git & GitHub?

Git is version control system designed by Linus Tornvald, the creator of Linux kernel.

GitHub is web-based service for Git.

GitHub is mostly used for simple development of projects using version control. This allows user freely develop alone or collaborate with others. 

Moreover, GitHub is more or less a community, where people share and learn. Many of open source tools firstly appears on GitHub. Then other users could easily report bugs on your project, develop additional features, expand your project scope, *etc*.

##

Q: But I am not a developer, I AM DATA SCIENTIST, why should I use such a tool?

A: Because:

>- You (probably) write code too 
>- You (probably) work on the project with colleagues
>- You (probably) don't back-up your projects
>- You (probably) would like to access your projects anytime, anywhere
>- You can see this presentation via GitHub

Any more questions?

## Plan of mini workshop

1. Configure GitHub accounts with your computers
2. Create a repository on GitHub.com
3. Clone repo, create a file and write something sad 
4. Add, commit, push that sad file to GitHub
5. Clone your colleagues repository to your computer

## Configuring and Opening GitHub

Firstly setting yourself as a user:

```
$ git config --global user.name "exacaster"
$ git config --global user.email "exacaster@exacaster.com"
```

To confirm your settings:

```
$ git config --global user.email exacaster@exacaster.com
```

## Creating a repo on github.com

Everything in GitHub exist as repositories aka repos. One could imagine repo as a folder of project where all code or any files are stored. 

To create a repo on github.com:

- Open github.com
- Select 'New repository'
- Write down your repo name
- Click 'Create repository'

## Cloning repo to computer

Every (public) repo could be cloned to your local machine using SSH clone URL.

Imagine cloning just as simple copy & paste procedure with hidden Git structure skeleton.

Run on GitHub shell:

```
$ git clone ssh_clone_url
```

And go to cloned directory:

```
$ cd repo_name
```

Notice that additional information about repo appears on GitHub shell.

## README.md

Every repo has a Read-me file where short summary of project is stated. 

These files are written in Markdown (.md extension) formatting syntax which could be easily converted to HTML.

This presentation is written in Markdown too.

To create a file and open it with text editor, eg Notepad:

```
$ touch README.md

$ notepad README.md
```

Now write something about you future project and save the file.

## Adding, commiting and pushing

Once file is created, we want it to appear on github.com/username/reponame. 

This is done with three easy steps:

- Adding

  ```
  $ git add README.md
  ```
  
- Commiting

  ```
  $ git commit -m "initial commit"
  ```
  
- Pushing

  ```
  $ git push
  ```
